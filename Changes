0.03 2007/07/08
	* Added sufficient (stub) documentation so that the tests pass. Real
	  Documentation [tm] will be added when the API stabilises.
0.02 2007/07/07
	* Second public release; fixes the ugly callback strategy that was in
	  place, using references instead. Code is overall much cleaner and
	  easier to understand.

0.01 2007/07/07

	* First initial public release. More a developer's toy than anything
	  else.
