0.04 2007/07/19
    * Fix Incunabulum.pm to not depend on mod_perl 2 with a bit of a hack. It'll
      be fixed in a later version when I've had time to think about a proper way
      of doing it.

0.03 2007/07/08
	* Added sufficient (stub) documentation so that the tests pass. Real
	  Documentation [tm] will be added when the API stabilises.

0.02 2007/07/07
	* Second public release; fixes the ugly callback strategy that was in
	  place, using references instead. Code is overall much cleaner and
	  easier to understand.

0.01 2007/07/07

	* First initial public release. More a developer's toy than anything
	  else.
