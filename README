Incunabulum

Incunabulum's a plugin-centric MVC framework. Wait, what? No, I didn't forget
the word 'Web'. While development and initial conception of Incunabulum started
as a Web project (a blog, in fact -- how original!), the full realisation of the
design has shown that Incunabulum can be much more than a blog if the right
plugins are provided to it. You can do anything with Incunabulum that you can do
with the MVC framework, because that's all that Incunabulum provides.

Well, then, why would you want to use or develop for it? The same reasons you
use and develop for Perl: it does what you want in a way you want to do it, and
if it doesn't, you can *make* it do what you want.

STATUS

Right now, Incunabulum is at the developer's toy stage. What this means is that
it doesn't do much, or it does it in a broken way, or it's broken altogether, or
some random combination of the above determined by some source of randomness
that may, at random, be selected at random.

In very simple terms, to quote the Debian docs regarding unstable: if it breaks,
you get to keep both pieces. :)

UP AND RUNNING WITH Incunabulum

Right now, not all plugins are supported (whatever that means for code this
early in the development stages). Here's a list of those that are:

Model: Pg
Controller: mod_perl2
View: Test
Config: Hardcode

Everything else is unsupported (again, for whatever that's worth considering
the early state of this code).
